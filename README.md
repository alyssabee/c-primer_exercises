Exercises from C++ Primer (5th Edition)

Hiya! 

I will be using the C++ Primer 5th Edition to learn C++. 

This repository will serve as a place to post my own answers to the exercises in each chapter.

Some exercises may not be included. The focus in these solutions will be producing the output requested, as well as some emphasis on neatness and brevity. 

Enjoy!
